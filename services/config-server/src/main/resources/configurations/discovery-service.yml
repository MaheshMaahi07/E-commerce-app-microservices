#The provided code is a YAML configuration file for a Spring Boot application that uses Eureka,
#a service discovery and instance management component of the Netflix OSS stack.
#  This section configures the Eureka instance.
#  eureka.instance.hostname specifies the hostname of the Eureka instance.
#In this case, it's set to localhost.
eureka:
  instance:
    hostname: localhost

#  This section configures the Eureka client.
#  eureka.client.registerWithEureka specifies whether the client should register itself with Eureka.
#  In this case, it's set to false, meaning the client won't register itself.
#  eureka.client.fetchRegistry specifies whether the client should fetch the Eureka registry.
#  In this case, it's set to false, meaning the client won't fetch the registry.
  client:
    registerWithEureka: false #because we are creating eureka itself
    fetchRegistry: false # because we are creating eureka itself
#  This section configures the Eureka service URL.
#  eureka.client.serviceUrl.defaultZone specifies the default zone for the Eureka service URL.
#  In this case, it's set to http://${eureka.instance.hostname}:${server.port}/eureka/.
#  The ${eureka.instance.hostname} and ${server.port} placeholders will be replaced with the actual values
#  from the configuration file.
    serviceUrl:
      defaultZone: http://${eureka.instance.hostname}:${server.port}/eureka/ # last / is very important
#  This section configures the server port.
#  server.port specifies the port number that the server will listen on. In this case, it's set to 8761.
server:
  port: 8761

#  In Summary
#  This configuration file sets up a Eureka server that:
#
#  Runs on localhost
#  Doesn't register itself with Eureka
#  Doesn't fetch the Eureka registry
#  Uses the http://localhost:8761/eureka/ URL as the default zone for the Eureka service
#  Listens on port 8761
